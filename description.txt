## Project: Face Matching & Storytelling Website

### Overview
A web application where users upload a face image, and the system matches it with a famous personality (historical, political, sports, etc.), creates a cartoon version of the face, and embeds it into a personalized video story generated based on personality-based questions. The video includes AI-generated voice narration.

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Project Setup (on GitHub Codespaces)

### Tools & Technologies
- **Frontend:** React.js (Vite), TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js)
- **Face Processing:** OpenCV.js / Python OpenCV (via API)
- **ML Models:** FaceNet or similar pre-trained models (for face matching)
- **Cartoon Generation:** ML model (e.g., Toonify or custom GAN model)
- **Video Generation:** FFmpeg, Canvas API
- **AI Voice-over:** Google Text-to-Speech / ElevenLabs
- **Deployment:** GitHub Codespaces, optional Vercel/Render

### Steps
1. Initialize Vite + React in GitHub Codespaces
2. Setup Node.js server with Express
3. Connect frontend and backend via REST APIs
4. Add Tailwind for utility-first styling
5. Setup file upload system

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Face Matching Feature

### Functionality
- Upload face image
- Use FaceNet (or similar) to extract face embedding
- Match with pre-encoded dataset of famous faces
- Return closest match with confidence score

### Steps
1. Preprocess and encode dataset (Python script, one-time)
2. On user upload, extract embedding
3. Compare using cosine similarity
4. Send match result to frontend

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Cartoon Generation

### Functionality
- Generate a cartoon avatar from uploaded face
- Use pre-trained model (Toonify or GAN-based)
- Save cartoon image

### Steps
1. API endpoint for cartoon generation
2. Process uploaded image and return cartoon
3. Store output for use in story generation

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Personality Quiz + Story Generation

### Functionality
- Ask personality-based questions (MBTI-style or themed)
- Use responses to select a story template
- Integrate cartoon image into story scenes
- Generate final storyboard content

### Steps
1. Quiz UI and logic on frontend
2. Template logic in backend
3. Inject avatar into selected story slides

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: AI-Generated Video & Narration

### Functionality
- Convert story + cartoon images into a video
- Add AI-generated speech (voice narration)
- Compile into downloadable/shareable MP4

### Steps
1. Create frames using story and cartoon
2. Generate speech using text-to-speech API
3. Combine visuals + audio using FFmpeg

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 6: Social Sharing Feature

### Functionality
- Allow users to share results/video on social media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)

### Steps
1. Add buttons with share intent links
2. Pre-fill title/description
3. Optional: Upload final video to a temporary server or use blob link

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 7: Optional Database Integration (Final Phase)

### Use Cases
- Store user interactions
- Save generated content (match, cartoon, story)
- Analyze personality trends (Data Analytics)

### Suggested Tools
- MongoDB / Firebase / PostgreSQL (depending on needs)
- Analytics: Python (Pandas), D3.js for dashboards
